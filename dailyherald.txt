From The Brown Daily Herald 12/31/2016:

Community members returned to campus this year to find the campus taken over by public art. The new installations were met with controversy upon their installation, most notably Urs Fischer’s “Untitled Bear/Lamp,” which was lovingly (or less so, depending upon your stance) nicknamed “Blueno” by some Brown students.

The new art may have seemed to appear overnight, but in fact represents the product of months of discussions within Brown’s Committee on Public Art, which we explore in-depth.
